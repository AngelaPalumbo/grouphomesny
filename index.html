          The <a href="https://acl.gov/about-acl/authorizing-statutes/developmental-disabilities-assistance-and-bill-rights-act-2000"> Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act </a> defines a developmental disability as a severe,
          chronic disability of an individual that is attributable to a mental or physical impairment or
          combination of mental and physical impairments. Some of these disabilities include autism, down's syndrome and cerebral palsy.

          According to the census bureau, In the United States there are more than <a href="https://disabilityjustice.org/justice-denied/disability-demographics/"> 57 million people </a> with some sort of
          disability, including developmental. As children, developmentally disabled individuals usually receive constant care from their
          families, schools and aids. As adults, circumstances change, and without schools and with elderly parents, many families turn to group home services to ensure their loved ones get constant, attentive care.

            There are over 200 group home agencies for the developmentally disabled in the state of New York. For families with adult individuals with any form of disability who are deciding whether or not to move their loved one into a group home,
            the
            decision can be intimidating and overwhelming.

            Leona Palumbo, a day habilitation coordinator for Independent Group Home Living on Long Island, has worked for different group homes on the East Coast since 1979. Palumbo says she recognizes the challenges of deciding to put an adult
            child
            into a group home, but after working in the field for years, she says she also recognizes the importance of the process.

            “In the normal course of life, an adult leaves their parents home and moves out, so it’s a sense of normal for their adult child with a disability,” Palumbo said. “As parents get older, they don't have the same ability to take care of
            an
            adult child with developmental disabilities, so this is a way families can relieve the pressures for both parents and their adult children.”

            “The closer group homes are to a parents home, the more convenient it is,” Palumbo said. “Parents can come visit as they please and be a part of the transition process. This makes it easier on everyone.”

            The decision to transition where a loved one with a developmental disability lives is a challenging one. Knowing the benefits of bringing family to one of these homes and their locations can be not only important, but helpful in the
            transition process.
